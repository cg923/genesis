<h1>Description/Unrealistically Ambitious Proposal</h1>

<p>__________ is a map creation game.  The map begins with a small plot of land, 
and when Player 1 moves around, new land is created.  Player 2 (or the computer)
is a monster, and when they move around, land is destroyed.  In the "timed" game-mode,
Player 1 wins if they successfully create a certain amount of land within the time limit.
Player 2 wins by destroying enough land to prevent this.  In the "endless" game-mode, 
Player 1 wins by filling the entire map, and Player 2 wins by destroying the entire map.
Each player has three special abilities they can use to temporarily freeze their opponent,
speed themselves up, or scramble their opponent's controls.  Each special ability has a cooldown.
Lastly, powerups will occasionally appear and the player who reaches it first gains its benefit...
or suffers its punishment!</p>
